These are 44 advanced fractal and 3D ISF shaders I have heavily customized from shadertoy as well as some created from scratch. Releasing them under creative commons non-commercial license, free to use for live performances, vjing as well as modifying and releasing under same license. They were tested and working perfectly on isf.video website and isf editor. Most of them work best in magic music visuals and rather well in madmapper in the tests I did. Support for ISF in touchdesigner and heavym is buggy only about 40% of all the ISFs I test eve work in them (I have not had the chance to make resolume wire patches but I suppose they should work better there).
